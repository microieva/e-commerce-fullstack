# Fullstack project

### Read this section carefully.

At this point you have two repositories:

Frontend and backend code:

1. [fs16-frontend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs16_6-frontend-project)
2. [fs16-backend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs16-backend)

You should `NOT` copy paste the code to this repo instead do this:

1. Open a PR in your frontend and backend
2. Copy the links of the both PRs
3. Open a PR here and leave as a comment both links

Backend project is a team project so:

1. Fork the repo you have been working with.
2. for instance if you are in team 5 you would fork the [forked repo](https://github.com/arf1e/team-5-backend/tree/main)
3. then go to [fs16-backend](https://github.com/Integrify-Finland/fs16-backend)
4. Open a PR -> compate across forks -> choose your repo.

### Requirements:

1. Connect your frontend with the backend server

- Here's a suggested plan
  - connect the basic routes
  - then worry about authentication and authorization
  - add the remaining routes the more advanced one like order or borrowing
  - if you have time left add more features - `THIS IS OPTIONAL`

2. Make sure you have some Testing (not necessarily a 100% coverage) in the backend if you didn't have the time to do it during the backend project.
3. **Repository to be public with a good README and project is hosted** This is a MUST to be done by the deadline.

### Additionally:

- make sure your code is clean
  - good folder structure, naming conventions, remove dead code
- if you are interested in jobs as frontend end make sure you focus on the UI/UX

## Common mistakes:

- Not having a plan
- Having plan BUT you don't stick to it.
  - You could have a ticket system (use Trello)
- Spending too much time on a feature or styling and block all other tasks
  - You could simply ask in the tech channel (what is the problem and what have you done to solve it)
  - Simple, skip it.
  - Do anything but blocking your time in solving a problem that doesn't really make any huge impact or not in your interest to learn or improve
- Not being active or proactive when you have potentially a common issue.
- Ooh I have 3 weeks (1_814_000 seconds), plenty of time.
